# AutoEmoteResponder
Automatically respond to any targeted emotes on you in WoW Classic with an emote

Usage: type /ae or /autoemote to start
Pop up box has a list of available emotes that can target you, a text box where you can type the emote you wish to respond with (DO NOT put a / in this box, only the name of the emote), and a checkbox if you want to emote at the person who targeted you first or not.

To use custom emotes, start the response with "me" and optionally you can include "PLAYER" and check off the target button to include the targets name as part of your custom emote. View the screenshots section for an example set for the Bye emote.

If you find an emote that someone targetted you with but are unable to find in the list it may not exist or if you have any issues feel free to join https://discord.gg/9CMhszeJfu and send a message in support.
